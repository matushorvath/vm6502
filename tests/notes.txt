msbasic:
memory.s:154, rts returns wrong?
because jsr stores wrong return address to stack? init.s:400 jsr REASON

string.s:61 is last valid instruction, LDA indirect,Y
next is 0c invalid opcode

string.s:533 is the last JSR before crash


looks OK:
up to c930: RTS(60)
up to d1e9: ADC(65) STRNG1(c4)
suspect that ADC is not working, it's the first ADC executed
